Here's a `README.md` file that follows the format you requested. You can customize it further based on the specifics of your project.

# Project Name

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
- See `requirements.txt` for additional dependencies.

## Model Loading

Models should be trained and saved before loading. You can follow a similar approach as shown in `run_model.py`.

### Loading Trained Models

To load the pre-trained models:

```python
from transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration

# Load the model from the saved path
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained(tokenizer_path)
```

### Modifying the Tokenizer

For custom token representations (such as for command sequences), you will need to add special tokens to the tokenizer's vocabulary.

```python
# Add custom tokens to the tokenizer
tokenizer.add_tokens(['</[DEL]/>', '</[INS]/>', '</[LOC]/>'])
```

Make sure that your model is resized to accommodate the new tokens:

```python
model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))
```

## Dataset Preparation

Make sure to prepare your dataset in the appropriate format. The dataset should be split into training, validation, and test sets.

For each pair of buggy and fixed code, label the buggy lines with `<BUGS>` and `<BUGE>`, and the corresponding fixed lines with `<FIXS>` and `<FIXE>`. The labeled sequences will then be tokenized using the tokenizer.

### Example Dataset Format

- **Input** (buggy code): 
    ```
    def add_numbers(a, b): <BUGS>if a = b<BUGE>: return a + b
    ```

- **Target** (fixed code):
    ```
    def add_numbers(a, b): <FIXS>if a == b<FIXE>: return a + b
    ```

## Training

Once your data is ready and models are loaded, you can train the model. Ensure that you have a valid training loop set up in your training script (e.g., `train_model.py`). 

The basic training loop should use a suitable loss function, optimizer, and possibly some regularization methods to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

## Inference

To use the trained model for inference:

```python
# Set the model in evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Encode the input sequence and generate predictions
input_ids = tokenizer.encode("Add two numbers", return_tensors='pt')
output = model.generate(input_ids)

# Decode the generated tokens back to text
predicted_code = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```
